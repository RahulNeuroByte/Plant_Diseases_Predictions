# Plant_Diseases_Predictions

Plant_Diseases_Predictions is a Machine Learning and Deep Learning-based web application built using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **OpenCV**, and **Streamlit**. The app is capable of detecting plant diseases from leaf images uploaded by users. It uses a **pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN)** model to classify the disease and displays the prediction along with the **confidence score**.

##  Features

- Upload leaf images for disease prediction.
- Displays the predicted disease name.
- Shows the prediction confidence level (%).
- Clean and interactive user interface using Streamlit.
- Fast and accurate classification using pre-trained CNN.
